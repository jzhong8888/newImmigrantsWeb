      <a>About My Topic</a>
    </h2>
    <p id="header-left">New immigrants to the United States are likely to encounter various problems in economy, language communication, psychology and so on. It takes a long time for new immigrants to adapt to the new life because of their unfamiliarity with the United States and cultural differences. This is likely to be a difficult time for them. Therefore, it is hoped that the public can be more tolerant and offer help to the new immigrants.

Imagine you've just arrived in a completely new environment, don't speak the language, don't know anyone, and have no idea how to ask for help. There are more than a million new immigrants every year, and most of them face a variety of problems. It would be wonderful if we could help them adjust to a new life. We'd like to invite you to join us in signing this petition in support of new immigrants.
